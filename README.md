# Cyclistic
Introduction : Welcome to the Cyclistic bike share project! In this project, I have performed real-world-based tasks to carry out data-driven results. To answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, and ACT.

Tools Used: Excel, SQL and R

Cyclistic : A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Scenario: The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the Analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Based on the insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
